//type inference does not apply to logical statements and will translate without complaint
//I wasn't sure whether I should throw an error or assert the types here
//The ASM code outputted calls String:less when it reaches the conditional statement

x = "Hello";
y = 3;

if x < y {
    z = "A string is less than an int?";
    z.print();
